Pronouns! For when you want to talk about someone without using their name over and over. Being trans, I've thought about and experienced a lot of very interesting things about pronouns over the years. Turns out, they're both simpler and more complex than they seem.


I'd also like to mention that [I talked about this][Previous Pronouns Post] in my previous blog in 2015, which I'm migrating to this blog along with this post. Feel free to go see how I thought about this over 5 years ago 😁



# What pronouns are valid? #

In general, if someone says they prefer a certain set of pronouns, that's perfectly valid. Quite a few have come along over the past many years, and quite a few of those have fallen out of favor. I'm gonna take this opportunity to do my favorite thing and make a table!

# Singularity vs. Plurality #

The Contentious One™: is "they/them" singular or plural? Well, I have a strong opinion on this, which comes from my experience living amongst a certain group of people:

Kinda happening alongside the movements to improve acceptance of gender and sexuality, is a similar movement for plurality, meaning **multiple people sharing one body**. These groups often refer to themselves as **systems**. Many folks in my life are or have been plural: Three of my ex-partners, two of my closest friends, one of my ex-<cite class="help" title="A metamour is one's partner's other partner">metamours</cite>, and many of my friends, each share their body with at least one other person. For some of these folks, I only knew one headmate; for example, one of my closest friends for the past decade shares a body with someone else, but I don't know the other at all. Plurality takes many forms, and I highly encourage you to [read about plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(psychology)), since it's a fascinating still-developing topic in society.

Clearly, it's expected and acceptable for members and outsiders to refer to these plural systems using plural language. "They tend to like chillhop," or "one of them is a girl," or "we decided to start a YouTube channel."

Because of this, I take the strong position that **"they/them" can be used for both singular and plural subjects, but must be conjugated properly**. For example, here's a sample paragraph about an individual:

#### Try this sample quote by using the pronouns below: ####

> <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span> is taking a walk with me, and <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">they</span> stops to pick up a cool rock. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span> hands it to me and smiles, and I smile back at <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-objective">them</span>. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-possessive-determiner">Their</span> grin is far more valuable than the rock. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span>'s proud of <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-reflexive">themself</span> for making me smile too.

# What about other languages? #

Another difficult subject is inherently-gendered languages. In English, we mostly encounter gendered language only with pronouns, but often also see gendered words like `waitress` or `king`. Quite often, they are in the form of "here's the masculine root word, and a suffix which makes it feminine", so one would call all wait staff "waiters", all acting in a movie "actors", and perhaps all monarchs "kings". Societally, this is nearly universally accepted, even if begrudgingly as "politically-correct".

Then, we see romance languages like Español and Français. Since I know Español, I've been a little active in the Español-speaking [SGM] community.  While [there are many proposals and debate][Wikipedia/Genderless Español] over what's the right approach, one that I prefer and which seems to be gaining traction is to generally replace the `a` and `o` which signify the gender of a word with `e`. For words like English has where there's a base and then a suffix which indicates the gender (e.g. `un` vs `una`), simply drop the suffix. Of course, there are corner cases, so for `él`/`ella`, the replacement would be `elle`, etc.



#### Try this sample quote with and without gender: ####

> <span data-español-gender="sample">Ariel reunió les ingredientes y hornear un pastel para Navidad. Ahora, elle tiene un pastel muy deliciose.</span>

<ul class="show-only-when-js-is-enabled   plain inline content-replacer chips" data-replaced-element-selector="[data-español-gender]" data-content-replacer-data-source="español-gender" data-content-replacer-data-replacement="gendered-español">

    <li><button class="accented chip mutates-page" data-gendered-español="genderedFeminine">gendered (feminine)</button></li>
</ul>

    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #EC407A, #880E4F);
}

[data-gendered-español="genderedMasculine"][selected] {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #29B6F6, #1A237E);
}
</style>

<script>
const españolSamples = {
    "nonGendered": {
        "sample": "Ariel reunió les ingredientes y hornear un pastel para Navidad. Ahora, elle tiene un pastel muy deliciose."
    },
    "genderedMasculine": {
        "sample": "Ariel reunió los ingredientes y hornear un pastel para Navidad. Ahora, ello tiene un pastel muy delicioso."
    },
    "genderedFeminine": {
        "sample": "Ariel reunió los ingredientes y hornear un pastel para Navidad. Ahora, ella tiene un pastel muy delicioso."
    }
}



$(function() {
    document.addContentReplacer("[data-español-gender]", (dataSource, dataReplacement) => {
        return españolSamples[dataReplacement][dataSource]
    })
})
</script>

As you can see, the syntax hardly changes with this approach. Of course, other langauges have their own specific challenges, but I am not a part of those communities. Hopefully, this global movement will encourage them to create genderless approaches to their languages as well 🤞🏼



# My Pronouns #

This is _my_ blog, so I'm sure you've been wondering about _my_ preferred pronouns. I have none! Call me him, her, them, em, it, whatever you want as long as you respect me. Still, I think it's good to get that out of the way so you understand my experience. **I don't care what pronouns you use for me**, as long as you use them respectfully. My birth family and co-workers call me he/him, my chosen family usually calls me she/her, and my girlfriend likes using random pronouns each time. All feel equally good to me! Though, there is one set of pronouns that I enjoy more than the others: **e/er/em**. [I independently invented these][Previous Pronouns Post] when I was in college, around 2011.

It turns out that many others in the past have invented [pronoun sets that are very similar][Wikipedia/Pronouns] (e/em/es, ey/em/eir, E/Em/Eir). I still prefer mine because I find them to be simpler (all lower-case, not too short), and also less connected to existing pronouns (some others seem to draw a lot from from they/them).

So, it warms my heart when folks use e/er/em pronouns for me, but other than that I honestly have no preference. This lack of preference is a part of [my experience](/Non-Binary) of being [greygender]. I still take great efforts to respect others' pronouns; it's a basic courtesy that doesn't harm me and helps them greatly.
