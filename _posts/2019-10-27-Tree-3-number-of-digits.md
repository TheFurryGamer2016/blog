I have a question, but I don't have an answer. I pose this to the mathematics community.


# Defining "hops" #

For the sake of this question, I will be talking in terms of decimal (AKA base 10).

One trillion (1,000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000) is 13 digits long. 13 is 2 digits long. 2 is 1 digit long. It took me 3 hops to get to 1 (1,000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000 ➡️ 13 ➡️ 2 ➡️ 1). Because of this, I say that 1 trillion **"has 3 hops"**.

One [googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) <small>(10,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000,<wbr/>000)</small> also **has 3 hops** (1 googol ➡️ 100 ➡️ 3 ➡️ 1).

One [googolplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex) <small>(I'm not writing that here)</small> **has 4 hops** (1 googolplex ➡️ 1 googol ➡️ 100 ➡️ 3 ➡️ 1).



# Actual question #

How many hops does [TREE(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem#TREE(3)) have? [It has been proven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P6DWAwwViU) that it is impossible to store the actual value of TREE(3) in the known universe, but we _do_ know that it _is_ finite. If it is finite, then it has some number of digits.

**Is that _number_ of digits small enough to store in the known universe?** If not, what about the number of digits in that number of digits?

Finally, **how many hops does TREE(3) have?** And will the value of that hop number fit in the known universe?

If you can figure this out, please let me know by contacting me at [any of my listed contacts](/about). Cheers!
